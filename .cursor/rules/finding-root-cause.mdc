### Steps for Finding Root Cause

1.  **Gather information:** Collect all relevant data, logs, and error messages. Understand the context and circumstances.
2.  **Formulate hypotheses:** Based on the information, propose potential causes for the problem.
3.  **Prioritize hypotheses:** Evaluate hypotheses based on likelihood and ease of testing.
4.  **Test hypotheses:** Design and perform experiments or checks to validate or eliminate each hypothesis. Add debug output as needed to gain evidence.
5.  **Iterate:** If the root cause is not found, refine hypotheses, gather more information, and repeat the testing process.
6.  **Identify root cause:** Pinpoint the specific reason for the problem based on conclusive evidence from testing.
7.  **Verify fix:** Ensure the proposed solution resolves the problem and does not introduce new issues.
